That changed in 1458 when Luca Pacioli introduced double-entry bookkeeping, reducing the need for trust and enabling businesses to scale to corporations, laying the foundation for our global economy.\n\nYet, even with this system, risks remained: Can we trust accounts, amounts, and promises, knowing they could be altered? Blockchain is the next evolution of trust. It makes every transaction verifiable, every decision traceable, and every record immutable. Blockchain doesn’t eliminate bad actors, but it makes it far harder for them to do damage, creating a new era of built-in transparency.\n\nI believe Cardano is the best platform to build that trust-less financial ecosystem which will benefit all mankind. As a DRep, I’m committed to helping guide Cardano toward that end.",
      "motivations": "The Cardano ecosystem won the lottery when control of the protocol and treasury was handed to the community. But like most lottery winners, we risk squandering these resources and ending up broke. That’s why I volunteered to be a DRep—because Cardano has the potential to become a global powerhouse, but only if we manage its resources wisely. Too many see the treasury as ‘other people’s money,’ and that mindset will lead us to failure.\n\nWe’ve been given something valuable, and how we manage it will define Cardano’s future. If we waste these resources, we’ll become a cautionary tale. My goal as a DRep is to ensure every investment grows both the ecosystem and the treasury. We must demand discipline, focus on return-based spending, and stick to crypto’s core principles: fixed monetary policy and responsible inflation.\n\nI’m not here just to stop waste—I’m here to help Cardano realize its potential.

These forces not only amplify financial exclusion but also drive environmental degradation, pushing marginalised voices further to the periphery.

I recognize that for Cardano to be more than just a best-in-class cryptocurrency, it must become a model for governance—one that demonstrates how decentralized, inclusive decision-making can lead to sustainable success.\n\nBy prioritizing transparency, inclusivity, and collaboration, I will do my part to ensure that Cardano not only excels in technology but also leads by example in building a governance framework that can be a blueprint for the fut",
      "motivations": "In 2016, I learned what money truly is—not just a government-issued piece of paper, but faith in a system. To have faith in any system, I need to believe in the rules that underpin it. This belief led me to Bitcoin and, soon after, to Cardano. Since 2017, I’ve been a dedicated member of the ecosystem. While I’m not an influencer or programmer, I’ve remained actively engaged—first as a holder, then as an ITN delegator, as a DeFi participant, and now as a DRep.\n\nI’m not one to push any cryptocurrency, but I’m always eager to share the vision when asked. I believe in Cardano, I believe in its community, and I bring a perspective shaped by years of quiet, meaningful involvement.

My focus is on marketing, adoption, and game theory, and I will bring my expertise to the functional aspects of Cardano’s governance.\n\nI’ve often told my friends that while it’s important to understand the rules, it’s far better to write them. Over my career, I’ve spent years analyzing rules, contracts, and systems to identify pitfalls, avoid manipulation, and ensure fairness. Good governance is like a good game—the best ones are built on rules that everyone can agree on, and that’s the kind of governance I strive for.",

As an ADA holder since 2017 and a Stake Pool Operator (SPO) since the ITN with QUEEN Ada stake pool, I am committed to contributing to Cardano's future.\n\nI’m not the most active in the ecosystem, but I would prioritize listening to diverse viewpoints before voting on proposals. I believe in responsible spending and avoiding waste in ecosystem development.\n\nDecentralization is another key focus for me. I believe the current parameters favor large pool farms over smaller independent pools. I’d advocate for increasing k to allow more pools to operate profitably, thus improving decentralization and supporting a more distributed network.\n\nI aim to make informed decisions that align with Cardano’s values and ensure its continued growth.",
      "motivations": "I chose to become a DRep because I believe in direct democracy (one of the reasons I moved to Switzerland) and I would prefer to vote directly with the relatively large stake I have in cardano. The other reason is to offer an option for the delegators of QUEEN stake pool, some of whom would prefer to stay in house. Anyone else is also welcome, although, to be fair, I'm sure there are more qualified candidates out there.",

After years in IT, focusing on system administration and coding, I discovered Cardano in 2019. Its peer-reviewed research and proof-of-stake protocol inspired me to launch SNAKE Pool. I’m dedicated to providing reliable, transparent staking services and contributing to Cardano's mission of decentralization and financial inclusivity.\n\nI actively participate in Cardano’s on-chain governance initiatives, supporting the evolution of a decentralized and self-sustaining ecosystem that empowers its community.\n",
      "motivations": "My motivation to become a DRep stems from a deep commitment to the principles of decentralization and self-governance. Cardano’s on-chain governance is a groundbreaking technology in giving power back to the community, and I want to be part of shaping that evolution. As someone who has been actively involved in Cardano’s ecosystem and the operator of SNAKE Stakepool, I’ve seen the immense potential of distributed networks to foster transparency, fairness, and innovation.\n\nBeing a DRep would allow me to use my experience to bridge the gap between technical development and community needs. I want to help Cardano thrive as a self-sustaining ecosystem, driven by its users, and create a governance model that other blockchains aspire to follow.",

      "objectives": "I have been passionate about Cardano (ADA) since I first joined the community in 2021, which was before staking and decentralized finance (DeFi) were fully integrated into the ecosystem. During this time, I witnessed the transition from the Byron era into the Shelley era, which marked the beginning of decentralization and staking. I have watched the network grow through key upgrades like Shelley, Goguen, and Alonzo. I have seen ADA go from having no computational value outside of being a store of value, to now having smart contracts and a thriving DeFi ecosystem. It is now capable of running complex applications, even playing Doom, all while achieving the incredible milestone of 1 million transactions per second. As a fully committed Ada holder, I happily pledge to contribute to the continued success and sustainability of Cardano, by supporting proposals that empower individuals, reduce reliance on centralized systems, and ensure ADA's long-term dominance in the crypto space.\n",
      "motivations": "\nI want to be a DRep because I truly believe in and am all in on ADA and its global impact in the years, decades, and centuries to come. I've been following it for years, and have been telling my friends, family, and strangers about it and what it has achieved on a daily basis. Know that by delegating to me, I will always vote for the proposal that aligns with the core principles of decentralization, fairness, and innovation. I am committed to supporting proposals that prioritize the long-term growth of Cardano, empower individuals, and ensure that ADA continues to be a beacon of change in the blockchain space. You can trust that my votes will reflect the vision of a truly decentralized and community-driven ecosystem, one that benefits all holders and strengthens the global impact of Cardano. For example, we should not slash the treasury tax in half at such a low market cap because the treasury will get twice as large if we wait longer. We can consider tax cuts after we 10x. \n",
      "qualifications": "I’m just an average American who wants to see an end to the deep state's monopoly and an end to the centralized systems that have plagued this country since we killed JFK. I support the death of bureaucracy. I firmly believe that decentralized systems, like Cardano, offer a path to empowering individuals and reducing the overreach of centralized powers that have too often shaped our lives for their own benefit. I believe proof of stake and self governance allows us to guide the light of consciousness in a world with AGI/ASI and billions of humanoid robots. We must become the managers, together. I have a Bachelor’s of Science in Business Management. I have been a Trump supporter since 2015. I will approach every decision with a strong sense of responsibility and a commitment to the core values of fairness, decentralization, and sustainability with a long term perspective that can maintain our vision in becoming a valuable financial operating system for all people of this world.\n\n",

Our core belief is that blockchain technology can serve as a powerful tool to address global challenges, from climate change to financial inclusion. We seek to represent and advocate for proposals that prioritize environmental sustainability, ethical governance, and innovative solutions to real-world problems. By actively engaging with stakeholders, including small ADA holders and sustainability-focused projects, we aspire to amplify voices that share these values and ensure responsible growth of the Cardano network.",

With backgrounds in sustainability, technology, and blockchain advocacy, our team believes that being a DRep allows us to bridge the gap between blockchain innovation and sustainable development initiatives. We are driven by the desire to see blockchain not just as a financial tool but as a transformative force in addressing systemic issues, such as energy use and equitable access to resources. Professionally, our experiences in environmental advocacy, education, and blockchain development provide us with the tools to evaluate proposals holistically and ensure alignment with sustainable practices.",

We launched the first Cardano Impact Report, assessing ecosystem projects’ environmental and social contributions while setting standards for sustainability. We developed the Project Catalyst Impact Measurement System (IMS) to track and quantify project impacts, ensuring Catalyst-funded initiatives meet performance goals. Our team organized and created content for 25 in-person Project Catalyst Working Group workshops worldwide, shaping governance improvements. We also launched Impact Web3, powered by the Proof of Impact Platform, to measure outcomes, and Domino DAO, a decentralized organization promoting collective positive global impact. With a deep understanding of sustainability frameworks like the UN SDGs, we evaluate proposals based on their societal and environmental impacts.",

It's hard to explain why, but I'd really want to be able to contribute to a better world, where people have a much better chance at achieving their goals. No, I'll never achieve this myself, especially not alone. But I do see the potential of Cardano to provide the fundamentals to a global political/financial framework where this may become a possibility. Hence, I will employ all my technical knowledge, skills, and goodwill to aid Cardano fulfil its potential and steer it towards the path it was intended to follow.",
      "motivations": "As a DRep I'll fight against Cardano becoming a system where a closely-knit group of friends benefit the most. Don't get me wrong, I do not think this is the case right now, instead I'm referring to political structures outside of Cardano, that skim the profits produced by the masses, while neglecting their duty to serve them. That's right, many of us need a reminder that politicians were meant to serve us, and not to form a mafia-esque group of \"businessman\" making out-of-this-world gains, while the rest of us are told to be happy about being allowed to spend most of our life working while just barely getting by.\n\nI know, it might appear that Cardano is eons away from becoming a political structure where the above might get to be relevant, but it would be a grave mistake on our part to not pay attention to the political aspect of Cardano in the early stages. Once governance is set in its ways, it gets ever harder to change the fundamentals as time goes on.",

I want to make sure we continue to learn from our neighbors and start to better manage risk and innovation efforts.\n\nWith Voltaire upon us, I think we need more dReps with experience in and out of Cardano.

Since then, a lot of new apps have been built, a lot of new projects have been created, and Cardano has become a platform worth checking out. I have tried all the apps that are on this blog and I believe they can be your gateway to the new Cardano ecosystem.",

The practical limit on the success of a system is the amount of information available to the people who make the decisions.\n\nThe Cardano Blockchain has the power to bring Transparency, Immutability, Trustlessness and Decentralization to the structures we organize our communities with. Using this blockchain we can get more information to more decision makers and our communities will make higher quality and more decentralized decisions.\n\nWe cannot judge our success by how much fiat we attract. We must judge our success by how many people and how many communities and people we free.\n",

In any system a small number of people will always end up with most of the wealth. The key to solving this is Decentralization.\n\nAlso historically Governance selects for the most motivated and least moral in a population. People who use deceit and manipulation to obtain power can be defeated by Transparency. People who cheat can be defeated by immutability. Those who abuse systems and are corrupt can be defeated with trustlessness.\n\nI want to make these solutions happen.",

That decision will shape the next 20 years. I want to make sure Cardano is in that conversation technically, culturally, politically, and commercially.\n\nI bring experience in brand and corporate strategy and will vote to protect the vision of Cardano vision, challenge with respect, study the issues and represent the kind of governance that helps Cardano grow with strength, purpose, and long-term relevance.",

It needs people with external networks, real commercial experience, and a willingness to challenge the status quo when necessary.\n\nI bring a track record of building trust and influence with Web3 blockchain and mainstream media, enterprises, and blockchain industry insiders in Japan where Cardano has a strong community and there is an opportunity ahead to expand this exponentially.\n\nI want Cardano to be taken seriously by governments, C-suites, regulators, and everyday people. That will require more than on-chain activity it will require strategy, credibility, and connection. That’s what I bring, and that’s why I want to serve.",
      "qualifications": "I conduct strategic communications, business development, and reputation management campaigns for global brands.\nWith deep experience advising founders, navigating Japanese corporate politics, and working on secondment between local and global offices I can bring a seasoned approach to managing processes and resolutions.\n\nI’ve built strong working relationships with Japanese media, agencies, and executives in sectors relevant to blockchain adoption and trusted by local partners to provide a holistic overview to stakeholders for the success of their operations in Japan.\n\nI have extensive experience working with high-profile media and social media influencers in Japan and regularly advise on messaging, positioning, and engagement strategy. These are the kinds of tools Cardano will need to compete in the Japanese economy and across Asia.\n\nIn addition I have participated in governance conversations across Catalyst and other parts of the Cardano ecosystem.",

      "objectives": "As a DRep, I believe in the potential of decentralized governance to drive meaningful change in the Cardano ecosystem. I aim to ensure that the interests of the community, especially smaller stakeholders, are represented in key decisions. I believe in a transparent and inclusive governance model where all voices can be heard and contribute to the growth of Cardano. My primary goal is to empower ADA holders by representing their interests, ensuring their voting power is used effectively.",
      "motivations": "I want to become a DRep because I believe in the importance of community-driven governance and the opportunities Cardano offers for shaping a decentralized future. By serving as a DRep, I can help ensure that a broad range of voices is represented in the decision-making process, particularly those who may not have the time or resources to participate actively in every vote. In terms of experience, I’ve worked in roles that involve leadership, decision-making, and stakeholder management. These experiences have honed my ability to critically evaluate proposals and balance competing interests. My motivation is driven by a commitment to fairness and ensuring that proposals with the potential to benefit the ecosystem and its participants are supported.",
      "qualifications": "I bring valuable experience from my involvement in the Cardano Catalyst project, where I have served as both a Community Reviewer (since Fund 6) and a Veteran Advisor (since Fund 7). These roles have given me a deep understanding of the proposal evaluation process, as well as insights into what makes a project viable and beneficial to the ecosystem. Thus, I’ve learned how to assess proposals critically, considering both the technical feasibility and the long-term impact on Cardano. \n\nI believe i should also refer to the fact that I bring a unique perspective as a professional dietitian. My background in healthcare has given me a strong foundation in critical thinking, evidence-based decision-making, and ethical responsibility, all of which are crucial for evaluating proposals and making sound governance decisions.

I believe we are at the beginning of the new major technological revolution, and Cardano is well positioned to take the lead there. The revolution will be in part with AI + blockchain + DePIN narrative and that is my personal major interest. \n\nMy biggest fear for Cardano growth and adoption is unsupervised and unopposed spending of the treasury without 3rd party oversight. This could lead to depletion of the funds needed to nurture the growth in decades to come. Since I believe Cardano has the best chance to be the L1 of choice for many institutions, I have decided to bring my 15+ years of corporate management experience to the governance efforts to contribute in making it so.",
      "motivations": "My main objective is to contribute to Cardano success, mainly from the growth, adoption, business and governance angle.\n\nI have been a Cardano fan since 2020, actively participating since the end of ITN in all manner of activities. Acting closely as an Catalyst assessor/advisor and veteran assessor/advisor since Fund2.\n\nCurrently COO of NuNet, leading the OPS of a deep tech startup. I have helped steer NuNet to successfully growing up to 30+ people and reaching a point of transitioning from pure R&D focus to the rapid growth, with deployment on Cardano.\n\nWith over 15 years of experience in managing major infrastructure, power, and manufacturing projects, I want to bring this wealth of knowledge to the blockchain world. My formal education is in engineering, including an MSc in Civil Engineering and a certification in Executive Management and Leadership from MIT Sloan. Experience and formal education is a strong foundation for DRep role in the rapidly evolving blockchain industry.\n",
      "qualifications": "Having a strong STEM engineering background, coupled with actual management in major complex real world projects rounds the wisdom needed for this role. Overall exceptional analytical and logical decision making skills honed in physical business and transferred to Catalyst.\n\nNow, as a COO of a blockchain based deep tech startup I possess a wealth of knowledge from digital and physical world which I want to bring to the Cardano governance.\n\nBeing at the age of 44, I consider this a nice balance between enough of life experience and life energy for executing complex oversight.",

I’ll post every vote on X so you know where your ADA stands. \n",
      "motivations": "“I want to be a dRep because I’m an everyday staker with DNEWS. I see Cardano’s potential for regular folks like me. Governance feels tech-heavy; I’ll make it simple. \n\nI’m driven by the community and fairness—rewards should reach everyone. Personally, I’ve invested a lot of time, money and knowledge, learning crypto hands-on with few IT skills, just curiosity. \n\nProfessionally, I’m a news junkie—DNEWS hooked me with clear updates. I’ll share that: practical staking tips, news-driven votes, all on X @EverydayADA\n\nI want to grow our voice to 1M ADA delegated, proving non-tech stakers can shape the future. Delegate to me for practical, everyday governance that pays off.”",
      "qualifications": "As @EverydayADA\nmy qualifications come from staking and learning from DNEWS, and other news outlets.\n\nI’ve learned Cardano hands-on: staking rewards, pool dynamics, and governance basics.\n\nMy news obsession—honed by DNEWS and other outlets—keeps me sharp on updates like Voltaire and Chang, perfect for voting on treasury or APY GAs. \n\nI’m a communicator, breaking crypto down simply on X for everyday stakers. No coding, just hustle: I’ve tracked markets, joined pools, and now aim for 1M ADA delegated. \n\nMy knack for fairness and £ growth—pushing 6% APY or news projects—makes me a dRep who gets regular folks. Delegate to me for a voice that’s lived it.”",
